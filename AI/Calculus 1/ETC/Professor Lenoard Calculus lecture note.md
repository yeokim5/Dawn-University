##### Lines

> **point-slope form:** how to make a graph out of 좌표?

(-2,-3). after getting slope(2) do y - (-3) =  2(x-(-2)) 
y = 2x +1

> need to know how to find angle with slope, slope with angle
- if you know the tangent you can know the slope m.
	ex) θ = (pi/6)
	m = tan(θ)
	m = tan(pi/6)
	what is tan(pi/6)? it's cos(pi/6)/sin(pi/6)
	m = (1/2)/(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/3
	

	it wasrs backwords too. if i know slope i can know the angle.
	m = -1
	-> m = tan(θ)
	-1 = tan(θ) // multiply inverse function on each polynomial 
	tan^-1(-1) = θ
	tan^-1(-1) = (sqrt(2)/2)/(-sqrt(2)/2) : if you see unit circle
**  the inverse tanget(arctan) is simply saying what is the angle that will make the value inside input of the function$$
\tan^{-1}\left( \frac{\sqrt{ 3 }}{3} \right) = \tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{ 3 }}{3}
$$

##### Distance Formula
 The distance formula is a method used to calculate the distance between two points in a coordinate plane. It's derived from the **Pythagorean theorem**.

Consider two points (𝑥1,𝑦1)(x1​,y1​) and (𝑥2,𝑦2)(x2​,y2​) in a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. The distance 𝑑d between these two points can be calculated using the distance formula:

$$ d = \sqrt{ (x_{2}-x_{1})^2 + (y_{2}-y_{1})^2 }$$

오케이 일단 여기 까지인데 모르는게 너무 많았다. 삼각함수 기초가 너무 부족해. 정승제 5일 코스 보고 다시 이거 돌아오자.
